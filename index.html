    <h3 style="border-style:dotted; border-width:1px; margin:2%; padding:1%;">I make 2 animations, I researched both on w3schools.com, one of them creates gradients, my screen goes from yellow to blue
        when it is first opened I did this using hover and transorm code in css. The next rule I investigated was making different html pieces like images and text move around, I did this with keyframes and animation.
        Go ahead and refesh the page, hover your mouse over images, touch text boxes and check out the links!
